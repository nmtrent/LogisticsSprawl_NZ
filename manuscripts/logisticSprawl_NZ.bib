	abstract = {The organization of modern economies is built upon an efficient transport system and an increasing role is played by the logistics sector in overcoming the constraints of time and distance in modern supply chains. While a large body of literature is dedicated to the spatial distribution of firms and firm location choice in general, surprisingly little is still known about the location patterns of logistics firms, and more specifically about the role of accessibility in their location decisions. We use geo-referenced firm level data along with detailed information on transport infrastructure in order to investigate the geography of logistics firms in Spain. We place specific attention to the relationship between logistics firm location, accessibility, and urban structure. Our results show that these firms are located closer to highways and other transport infrastructure compared to other sectors and that the logistics sector is highly urbanized. Yet, they are also locating increasingly in suburban locations and to some extent in extra-urban locations with good accessibility while central cities of urban areas have experienced a declining share of logistics firms.},

	abstract = {Based on conditional logit models and recent census data, this paper attempts to study the influence of transport and other factors on the location of foreign logistics firms across Chinese cities. The results suggested that the location of foreign logistics firms depended on transport conditions in terms of roadway, railway and waterway, as well as market size, labor quality, agglomeration economies and government incentives. The importance of transport was found to vary with some firm-specific characteristics. Provincial roadway transport was more important for independent logistics firms and overseas Chinese firms compared to their counterparts. New logistics establishments were more sensitive to roadway transport infrastructure than mature firms. The implications for policy-makers are given in the end. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@book{KlauenbergCauduro2019,
	abstract = {The paper analyses the phenomenon of suburban concentration in connection with the spatial deconcentration of logistics locations in urban areas. By this, we are adding further insights to the concept of the logistics sprawl. For the region of Berlin-Brandenburg, we show that apart from the sprawl of logistics locations, there is a concentration of these locations in suburban regions. We applied classical concentration measures on data of companies in the WZ-2008 group 52.1 Warehousing and storage. Regarding the entire study area, medium-sized logistics companies are relatively more common than within the overall economy, whereas small logistics companies are relatively less numerous. In addition, large logistics companies are significantly more frequent in the suburbs of Berlin. This may indicate a fundamental structural difference of the logistics branch that is common to all regions from urban to rural, accompanied by a second overlapping concentration pattern that is most dominant in the suburbs and appears particularly for large logistics companies. The concentration of these logistics locations is higher in the surrounding area of Berlin than in the City of Berlin itself as well as in other areas of Brandenburg. Analysis of these logistics locations by Kernel density analysis revealed hotspots of the concentration around the City of Berlin in the suburban region of Brandenburg, dominated by a cluster in the south of Berlin.},

@article{Kumar_etal2017,
	abstract = {This article applies spatial cluster and econometric analyses to study attributes of the transportation and logistics cluster regions across the continental U.S., focusing on jobs, clustering, and dispersal patterns. Two questions are examined: 1) Is transport and logistics specialization a primary feature of large urban metropolitan regions or do rural nonmetropolitan regions (be they micropolitan or noncore) have the capacity to support this type of cluster? 2) Does transport infrastructure explain jobs in the transportation and logistics cluster? The research employs a county level lattice data of transportation and logistics cluster jobs from 2008 to 2012 as well as transport infrastructure variables. The findings reveal that the transportation and logistics clusters are concentrated primarily in metropolitan areas, and to some degree, in nonmetropolitan regions of the U.S. In addition, the transport infrastructure is found to have a positive impact on jobs in the transportation and logistics clusters over the period of the study. Intermodals have the largest effect on jobs, followed by airports, annual average daily traffic on the National Highway Planning Network, railroads, and ports.},

@article{Li_etal2017,
	abstract = {The logistics nodes and logistics enterprises are the core carriers and organizational subjects of the logistics space, and their location characteristics and spatial differentiation have significant impacts on the urban logistics space distribution and logistics resources allocation. Based on Tencent Online Maps Platform from December 2014, 4396 logistics points of interest (POI) were collected in Beijing, China. Adopting the methods of industrial concentration evaluation and kernel density analysis, the spatial distribution pattern of logistics in Beijing are explored, the interaction mechanism among the type difference, supplydemand factors and location choice behavior are clarified, and the internal mechanism of spatial differentiation under the combined influence of transportation, land rent and assets are revealed. The following conclusions are drawn in the paper. (1) Logistics enterprises and logistics nodes exhibit the characteristic of both co-agglomeration and spatial separation in location, and logistics activities display the spatial pattern of "marginal area of downtown area, suburbs and exurban area", which have a low coupling degree with logistics employment space. (2) The public logistics space, namely, logistics parks and logistics centers, is produced under the guidance of the government, and the terminal logistics space consisting of logistics distribution centers serving for the specific industries and terminal users is dominated by enterprises. They have obvious differentiation in location. (3) In the formation of the logistics spatial location, the government can change the traffic condition by re-planning the transport routes and freight station locations, and control the land rent and availability of different areas by increasing or decreasing the land use of logistics, to impact the enterprise behavior and form different types of logistics space and function differentiation. In comparison, logistics enterprises meet the diverse demands of service objects through differentiation of asset allocation to promote the specialization of division and form the object differentiation of logistics space.},

@article{Prause2014,
	abstract = {In the White Paper on Transport 2011 the European Commission stressed the concept of green transport corridors, i.e. transshipment routes with concentration of freight traffic between major hubs and by relatively long distances of transport marked by reduced environmental and climate impact while increasing safety and efficiency with application of sustainable logistics solutions. Green transport is based on inter-modality, powerful logistics hubs and advanced ICT-systems improving traffic management, increase efficiency and better integrate the logistics components of a corridor. Sustainable hub development along the transshipment routes of green corridors is one of the major tasks of green corridors in order to safeguard and meet the necessary corridor performance for the current and future transport demand. The main corridor hubs represent logistics clusters in the sense of Yossi Sheffi, comprising ports, logistics centers and other transshipment nodes. The paper will present results about the development of core logistics clusters representing hubs in green transport corridors and it will indicate actions for hub development with a future-oriented compilation of sustainable development measures of infrastructural, legal or organizational nature. Since the author took part in some important green transport corridor initiatives around the Baltic Sea, including "East-West Transport Corridor (EWTC II)" initiative, representing the first European project which delivered a green corridor manual formulating recommendationsand requirements of green transport corridors to European level, some case studies from EWTC project will be discussed.},

Knowledge on the spatial distribution patterns of LSP locations, e.g. to represent network routing of shipments more accurately, is of paramount importance. Moreover, attributes characterizing the LSP locations are helpful to relate them to traffic generation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present intermediate results of an empirical study on LSP locations in Germany. Drawing on these findings, the freight generated by German less than truckload networks is estimated on an aggregate level. These findings shed some light on the spatial and structural patterns of the locations allocable to the German logistics sector and the freight transport it generates. These insights are highly relevant for freight transport and land use planning policies.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes location dynamics of logistics establishments in relation to spatial clustering. Such an analysis is relevant for both decision makers within logistics firms and regional policy makers, as co-located logistics establishments as well as society as a whole can benefit from co-location of logistics establishments. For this analysis, longitudinal empirical data on logistics establishments in a Dutch province are used. Six general conclusions are drawn on spatial concentration and location decisions of logistic firms. First, logistics employment spatially concentrates in particular areas, called Absolute and Relative Concentration areas (AREC areas). Second, larger logistics establishments locate relatively often in AREC areas. Third, logistics establishments that relocate within the province locate relatively more in AREC areas than in other areas, while new logistics establishments do not. Fourth, logistics establishments from AREC areas are more likely to relocate in AREC areas than establishments from non-AREC areas. Hence, experience matters in location decisions of logistics firms. Fifth, transport establishments locate relatively often in emerging AREC areas. Finally, data on employment growth show that intermodal container terminals attract logistics employment, in their direct vicinity as well as on a municipal level. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper analyzes land allocation policies by means of a survey conducted in the south of the Netherlands. Results show that municipalities do not actively stimulate spatial concentration of logistics firms, although both aldermen and public administration employees acknowledge that co-location of logistics firms can lead to benefits. There is a need for cooperation between municipalities, such that a regional policy can be developed, to attain the regional benefits of logistics concentration areas, while local disadvantages (like congestion and CO2 emissions) can be reduced. Respondents acknowledge the positive effects of cooperation with respect to logistics land allocation, but recognize some impediments. Municipalities that already cooperate with others are positive about the results. Hence, municipalities are advised to build partnerships, such that land allocation policies can be better aligned with the stimulation of logistics concentration areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between freight accessibility and logistics employment in the US. It develops an accessibility measure relevant for logistics companies based on a gravity model. This allows for an analysis of the accessibility of US counties focusing on four different modes of transportation: road, rail, air, and maritime. Using a Partial Least Squares model, these four different freight accessibility measures are combined into two constructs, continental and intercontinental freight accessibility, and related to logistics employment. Results show that highly accessible counties attract more logistics employment than other counties. The analyses show that it is very important to control for the effect of the county population on both freight accessibility and logistics employment. While county population explains the most variation in the logistics employment per county, there is a significant relationship between freight accessibility and logistics employment, when controlling for this effect. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Verhetsel_etal2015,
	abstract = {Due to the globalization and the fragmentation of industrial production processes, the logistics sector, organizing the linkages between different production plants and the market, is growing fast. This results in an increasing demand for suitable new business locations. Previous research has indicated that accessibility is a key factor in the location decision making process. Though the literature on this subject is extensive, little research has been done to quantify the impact of the different dimensions of accessibility on the location decision process of logistics companies. This paper aims to fill this void in the literature by means of a revealed preference study (using a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis) and a stated preference study (using a designed discrete choice experiment) in Flanders (Belgium). The results of the revealed preference study served as input to the design of the choice situations in the stated preference study. In the stated preference study, the respondents were confronted with a series of choice situations described by means of accessibility variables as well as land rent information. An analysis of the resulting data by means of discrete choice modeling revealed that land rent is the most important factor in the location choice of logistics companies in Flanders. Access to a port is the second most important factor, followed by access to a motorway, the location in a business park and an inland navigation terminal, which are all about equally important.

@article{AlhoSilva2015,
	abstract = {Within the realm of urban logistics, Mac{\'{a}}rio (2013) developed a hypothesis, denominated the Logistics Profile (LP) concept that suggests homogeneous groups of urban zones with respect to three dimensions, which could be used to analyze freight movement policy: (1) the social and built environment; (2) characteristics of the goods/products being moved; (3) characteristics of the deliveries at the receiver establishment. The concept was expected to ease the transferability of best practices in city logistics, by analyzing similarities and differences between zones. This research uses a quantitative methodology to apply the LP concept, and assess its potential, using the city of Lisbon as a case study. The analysis is focused on: (a) the extrapolation of freight trip generation per establishment and delivery characteristics from a sample of commercial establishments to the population within the case study, (b) proposing a methodology to test the LPs, (c) testing the existence of proposed LPs. Freight trips have been extrapolated using a Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) model. Freight delivery characteristics were attributed to establishments from a sample-based probability distribution. LPs were tested using a two-step cluster analysis. Some LPs have been matched with clusters of case-study zones, subject to case study particularities. Profile overlap was not an issue and occurrences were expected. The testing showed that Logistic Profiles have the potential for being used as a departure point for urban freight planning and policy analysis.},

@article{Allen_etal2012,
	abstract = {This paper examines road freight transport activity and its relationship with facility location, logistics management and urban form through an analysis of 14 selected urban areas in the UK. Improved understanding of this relationship will assist planners when making transport and land use decisions. The findings suggest that several geographical, spatial and land use factors have important influences on freight activity in urban areas. Commercial and industrial land use patterns affect the types and quantities of goods produced, consumed, and hence the total quantity of freight transport handled. This also influences the distances over which goods are moved and by what specific mode. There has been relatively low growth in warehousing in many of the selected areas over the last decade compared to the national average as well suburbanisation of warehousing in some locations. This affects the origin and destination of journeys visiting these facilities and typically increases the distance of such journeys. A greater proportion of road freight has been shown to be lifted on internal journeys in large urban areas than in smaller ones. Journeys within urban areas have been shown to be less efficient than journeys to and from the urban area in the 14 locations studied due to the much smaller average vehicle carrying capacities and lower lading factors for journeys within urban areas. The length of haul on journeys to and from urban areas studied was found to be greatest for those areas with a major seaport and/or which were geographically remote. This affects the road freight transport intensity of goods transport journeys. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First to identify economic activities and broader spatial logistics functions that characterise an urban setting, and second to delineate significant spatial logistics employment clusters to represent the underlying regional geography of the logistics landscape. Design/methodology/approach: Using the four-digit Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification, industries "explicitly" related to logistics were identified and aggregated with respect to employment. A principal component analysis was conducted to capture the functional interdependence of inter-related industries and measures of spatial autocorrelation were also applied to identify spatial logistics employment clusters. Findings: The results show that the logistics sector accounts for 3.57 per cent of total employment and that road freight, postal services, and air and space transport are major employers of logistics managers. The research shows significant spatial clustering of logistics employment in the western and southern corridors of Melbourne, associated spatially with manufacturing, service industry and retail hubs in those areas. Research limitations/implications: This research offers empirically informed insights into the composition of spatial logistics employment clusters to regions that lack a means of production that would otherwise support the economy. Inability to measure the size of the logistics sector due to overlaps with other sectors such as manufacturing is a limitation of the data used. Practical implications: The research offers policymakers and practitioners an empirically founded basis on which decisions about future infrastructure investment can be evaluated to support cluster development and achieve economies of agglomeration. Originality/value: The key value of this research is the quantification of spatial logistics employment clusters using spatial autocorrelation measures to empirically identify and spatially contextualize logistics hubs. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: During the past few years, with the increase in air traffic and the expansion of airports, very few industries had such a large spatial development and movement impact as that of airport-related clusters or airport regions. Although much research was done on the various impacts of the airport industry, very little research was done on the air cargo industry in airport regions.Objectives: This article specifically explored the unique spatial relationships, impacts, trends and movement patterns of the air cargo industry within a typical airport region.Method: The article focused on the OR Tambo International Airport in Gauteng, South Africa, as a case study and was informed by an extensive quantitative spatial and land use analysis and modelling of the study area.Results: The article presented findings and insights on the movement patterns and relationships between (1) the airport facility and (2) the spatial configuration of air cargo industries in the particular airport region. These findings also provided some framework for a possible spatial model and guideline that could assist in steering and managing development and movement patterns in airport regions.Conclusion: The article provided new insights and understanding on the spatial dynamics of airport regions and the air cargo industry, ultimately addressing some gaps in this knowledge field. The article in the end highlighted the need for a different and novel approach to the planning and management of the air cargo industry in airport regions and a basis for further research. },

	abstract = {The acceleration of economic globalization and integration has led to a dramatic increase in the flow of goods worldwide and changes in the spatial location of logistics facilities. The location of logistics facilities affects not only the cost and efficiency of cargo transportation activities, but also the rational allocation of logistics resources. Recently, the two major perspectives of logistics space research-cluster (the concentration of logistics facilities and functions in geography) and sprawl (movement of facilities from the urban core to peripheral places) have received extensive attention from academia and policy makers. The evolution of logistics space is influenced by land prices, traffic accessibility, market demand, agglomeration advantages and government policies. The purpose of this study is to present a literature review of logistics space, including data sources, research methods as well as research theories, and to study the impact of logistics space from the perspective of sustainable development. The research results provide some reference for logistics space researchers and logistics facility planners, and play a role in formulating new logistics development strategies and promoting the sustainable development of logistics.},

@article{Raimbault2019,
	abstract = {Large urban regions are the main logistics markets. They concentrate warehouses, distribution centres and terminals in numerous logistics zones; they polarize thus regional, national and international flows. Some of these logistics facilities correspond to inland ports directly connected to seaport(s) with high capacity transport mean(s) either via rail, road or inland waterways. Their development results from the dynamic of port regionalization, which is characterised by seaports becoming integral parts of extensive hinterland networks, intermodal transport corridors and inland ports. Therefore, in city-regions, inland ports are part of larger logistics systems associating diverse logistics facilities and zones. The ways inland ports are governed, planned and owned must thus be understood in connection with the governance of the diverse logistics spaces at the metropolitan scale, including transport infrastructure and land use planning. Research has documented the very fragmented politics of logistics zones and the limited scope of spatial planning dedicated to logistics facilities and activities. The specific role and importance of the governance of inland ports within urban and regional governance arrangements framing and supporting logistics development is still unclear. In order to contribute to a systematic urban and regional approach of the connection between the governance of logistics development and the governance of inland ports in urban regions, the paper empirically analyses the inclusion of inland port spaces and institutions within Parisian metropolitan logistics strategies. Based on a qualitative methodology (policy documents and semi-structured interviews), it shows that inland port spaces and institutions take part in every metropolitan logistics policies. They constitute one of the few policy tools for both implementing regional planning and developing urban logistics sites in order to spatially (re)organize logistics facilities and activities. At the same time, inland port infrastructures are identified as strategic assets for a metropolitan agenda of economic competiveness, aiming at increasing port regionalization. In this perspective, inland port institutions contribute to the metropolitan governability vis-{\`{a}}-vis logistics issues but, finally, do not permit to regulate logistics sprawl.},

Recently, the phenomenon of logistics sprawl, i.e. the relocation of logistics facilities away from inner urban areas to suburban areas has received an increasing level of attention from both academics and policy makers. In this paper, a literature review of the various impacts of logistics sprawl is provided with a detailed taxonomy of the impacts. It has been observed that logistics sprawl contributed changes in geography of urban freight, increasing trucks' travelled distance and consequent emissions and impacting the commuting of logistics employment. The paper presents a summary of the empirical findings illustrating the additional distance trucks travel due to logistics sprawl in several European and North American cities. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of the measures and policies implemented in various metropolitan areas to reintegrate small-scale logistics facilities within inner urban areas to act as consolidation centres.},

	abstract = {The design of a spatial distribution structure is of strategic importance for companies, to meet required customer service levels and to keep logistics costs as low as possible. Spatial distribution structure decisions concern distribution channel layout--i.e. the spatial layout of the transport and storage system--as well as distribution centre location(s). This paper examines the importance of seven main factors and 33 sub-factors that determine these decisions. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) was used to identify the factor weights, with pairwise comparison data being collected through a survey. The results indicate that the main factor is logistics costs. Logistics experts and decision makers respectively identify customer demand and service level as second most important factor. Important sub-factors are demand volatility, delivery time and perishability. This is the first study that quantifies the weights of the factors behind spatial distribution structure decisions. The factors and weights facilitate managerial decision-making with regard to spatial distribution structures for companies that ship a broad range of products with different characteristics. Public policy-makers can use the results to support the development of land use plans that provide facilities and services for a mix of industries.},

A range of vehicle movement data can now be automatically collected from low cost sensors that are able to assist in improving understanding distribution systems and increasing their efficiency. Vehicle monitoring technologies that have the potential to charge both passenger and goods vehicles for using the road system, allow a new array of pricing schemes to be introduced. However, E-commerce (B2C) is creating a surge in home deliveries that is increasing the social and environmental costs of goods distribution systems. This paper describes some applications of big data systems and decision support systems that can be used to enhance the design and evaluation city logistics schemes. The need to develop improved tools for understanding logistics sprawl and reducing its effects are described. Developments in alternative fuel vehicles and advanced manufacturing systems are also presented.},

Successful implementation of growth strategies has multiple environmental and social benefits but also raises the demand for intra-urban goods movement, potentially increasing conflicts between modes of travel and worsening air quality. Because urban goods movement is critical for economic vitality, understanding the relation between smart growth and goods movement is necessary in the development of appropriate policies. This paper reviews the academic literature and summarizes the results of six focus groups to identify gaps in the state of knowledge and suggest important future research topics in five sub-areas of smart growth related to goods movement: (1) access, parking, and loading zones; (2) road channelization and bicycle and pedestrian facilities; (3) land use; (4) logistics; and (5) network system management.},

	abstract = {An increase in urban freight transport is inevitable as growing urban
populations require more goods, more conveniently. A deeper
understanding of the geography and trends of urban freight transport
must recognise that it is the aggregate result of a complex web of
supply chain interactions. To understand the trends, the behaviour of
the underlying supply chains must be understood. Using Global
Positioning System (GPS) traces of commercial vehicles and network
theory concepts, this paper examines the characteristics of supply chain
micro communities in three urban areas in South Africa. The similarity
in the structure of these micro-communities across the three, very
diverse, areas suggests that the dynamics that drive supply chain
interaction are not dependent on local geography. Four prominent
archetypes were identified that account for more than half of the
micro-communities in each area. Directionality, geographic dispersion
and the balance of importance in the micro-communities are studied in
the context of these archetypes. This paper presents a first puzzle
piece in deducing urban freight transport patterns from supply chain
interaction. Furthermore the results are an empirical benchmark that can
validate theoretic models of urban supply chain interaction.},

A modeling framework is developed to analyze decisions about location choice for logistic firms by using mixed logit models. In this framework, spatial effects such as the correlation between firms in deterministic terms and the spatial correlation among zones in the error term are captured by mixed logit models. In addition, the dynamics of the consumption of commodities between consumers and suppliers is considered. In a case study, the developed framework is applied to the Tokyo metropolitan area. The model is tested for retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers. The results of the study indicate that for location choice, the number of employees is a more important determinant for manufacturers than it is for retailers and product wholesalers. Additionally, the results indicate that the spatial effects and the land prices in a given zone strongly affect the decision-making process of all the firms in the metropolitan area.},

	abstract = {The locations and profiles of firms in the six-county Chicago, Illinois, region were used to compare the businesses' proximities to freeway ramps and transit stations for two time periods: 1981 and 1999. A series of regression models was constructed to assess whether the location patterns with respect to transportation facilities have changed over the last two decades. The data suggest that, controlling for exogenous factors, businesses have moved closer to freeway ramps in the last two decades. Meanwhile, the distance to transit stations has not changed except in the city of Chicago, where it has decreased. These findings suggest shifts in location choice behaviors in the urban core and the suburbs. Specifically, firms in the urban core areas are valuing access to rail stations to a greater degree, whereas those in the suburbs are placing more importance on proximity to freeway ramps. The concentration of businesses near expressway ramps in the inner and middle suburbs suggests the emergence of a pattern in those areas that corresponds to a polycentric development, with freeway ramps as the focal points. Finally, the findings indicate a shift, not a decrease, in the importance of transportation access for business location choice.},

Estimated reduced-form W{\&}D rent functions suggest that the influence of these predictors varies across small and large W{\&}D facilties, presumably differing in the geographic scope of their operations. Small W{\&}D facility rents are seen to be determined by the multiplicity of location factors already mentioned; in contrast, large W{\&}D facility rents, seemingly unaffected by local market access and local zoning controls, are found to be mostly driven by surface and air-transportation access advantages. Overall, these findings suggest a role for a public policy aiming at facilitating the functioning of the W{\&}D sector within contemporary metropolises.},

The results based on spatial presentation and statistical models show that warehouses are disproportionately located in minority neighborhoods, regardless of the differences in urban contexts. In specific, medium-income and low-income minority neighborhoods are more likely to have higher concentration of warehouses than medium-or-low-income white ones. The four metros are diversified in the roles of global trade, land availability, and the size of the warehousing industry. However, the spatial patterns are found consistent across these metros, suggesting that the environmental justice problem in warehousing location is a common concern.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to consider the spatial distribution of freight and logistics facilities in both the Paris region and the Paris megaregion (the Paris basin) between 2000 and 2012. A major rise in the number of warehousing and logistics facilities has been documented since the beginning of the 2000s in both areas. In terms of spatial characteristics, this growth illustrates both centrifugal processes, from the urban core to the suburban and exurban areas of the region, and centripetal processes, from the margins of the Paris basin to the edges of the Paris region. The logistics system is a global distribution process from international supply chains to urban supply chains. In this process, freight hubs serve as switches connecting these two scales of the logistics system. This role explains part of the locational patterns of logistics and warehousing facilities in Paris, both at the metropolitan scale of the Ile-de-France region and at the megaregional scale of the Paris basin. Areas of further research are provided; these could help establish and better specify the megaregional nature of the Paris basin as far as freight and logistics facilities are concerned.},

	abstract = {Changes in the way that raw materials, intermediate goods, and finished products move through the American economy have altered the role and increased the importance of warehouses. This article examines the changing geography of warehouses in the US between 1998 and 2005. The distribution of the warehousing industry is examined to discern the degree to which the expansion of warehousing has gravitated towards places with superior accessibility in the nation's air, maritime, rail, and highway transportation networks. The analyses indicate that the number of warehousing establishments in 2005 and the 1998-2005 growth in the number of warehousing establishments across a sample of 143 metropolitan counties were strongly correlated with county-level measures of accessibility in air and highway and to a lesser extent rail networks. These results could be useful to communities interested in harnessing this dynamic part of the economy for economic development. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates small road haulier's spatial location and road network accessibility in relation to proposed freight consolidation centres (FCCs). For many decades, the overall load factor in freight vehicles has decreased; smaller volumes of goods have been transported over longer distances. To counteract this, a well-planned localisation of FCCs has been suggested as a measure to improve transport efficiency. Based on 3,024 road hauliers, road haulier associations, freight forwarders, and delivery firms/couriers located in the Western part of Sweden, the analysis show a high concentration of small road hauliers towards the largest city, its immediate surroundings, and towards existing facilities of large freight forwarders and road haulier associations. Furthermore, the accessibility analysis shows that a very large majority of the small road hauliers as well as large forwarders and haulier associations are reached within a short time distance from the proposed FCCs, indicating the potential to establish FCCs serving small road hauliers. While it is not possible to conclude that the `proposed' FCCs are optimally located, the paper provides a basis to further investigate the most appropriate locations of FCCs serving the city and its surroundings, and whether and under what conditions FCC establishments are viable.},

	abstract = {Physical distribution, logistics and freight transport are currently being shaped by new technologies, corporate restructuring, and a changing market environment. Following the rapid growth of logistics, the demand for distribution facilities increases significantly. As a consequence, logistics real estate markets have emerged, shaping local development practices. By establishing distribution centres as single entities and integrated freight centres as agglomerations, they contribute to the formation of 'regional distribution complexes'. The paper aims to exemplify this interrelation with two case studies in Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany: first a publicly developed integrated freight centre, offering multi-modal transport access and logistics services, and second a dispersed logistics site off the regional beltway, developed with respect to market requirements only. The paper finds that rising locational competition contributes to accelerated land consumption and further dispersal. Speculative development and outsourcing of facilities are 'mobilising' not only goods flows but also logistics infrastructure. Both practices, originally developed in the USA and the UK, are now changing land markets in continental Europe and affect urban and regional development. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG.},

	abstract = {Extremely popular within 'Nederland: Distributieland' are the so-called European Distribution Centres (EDCs). In these centres consumer goods are prepared for the ultimate customers in the whole or in a big part of the West European market. Many publications stress the strong competitive position of the Netherlands for EDCs, especially those of the Holland International Distribution Council. Four arguments are generally given to explain the attractiveness of the Netherlands for the location of EDCs. The first has to do with the presence of the seaport of Rotterdam and the airport Schiphol, the second concerns traditional Dutch competences in the field of transport and logistics. The third and fourth factors are closely related. The third deals with changes in the organisation of production and distribution. Formerly many firms producing consumer goods used a 'direct distribution system'. They delivered to their customers directly from their plants. Three changes have occurred since then: many activities that used to be located in or near that plant are now physically separated from that plant; an increasing number of firms producing consumer goods is now relying on external suppliers of components and modules; the firm's customers are increasingly asking for products that exactly fit their needs and taste.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of global production networks (GPNs), the associated network of freight distribution has gained increasing significance. Whereas the volume of freight transport is expected to increase further, the supply of infrastructure for the movement and handling of consignments appears limited. Particularly at the interfaces, infrastructure capacity for coping with rising throughput is extremely scarce. Any attempt to widen bottlenecks seems to be risky because it happens at some cost and in a contested political and urban environment. This problem will be discussed in the case of the German North Range, with the Port of Hamburg as the traditional gateway and main port, and a scattered system of secondary interfaces and supporting logistics areas. Local constraints, port competition, and the network logic of global distribution systems are challenging the former monopoly of the port, as are plans for establishing a new deep-sea port at Wilhelmshaven, 150 km west of Hamburg. At the same time, the traditional policy approach of adapting to the needs of the distribution system is coming to an end, owing to fiscal limits, infrastructure constraints, and the generic logic of the global supply chain. In accordance with the emerging global division of labor, various actors and institutions are involved in the management of the chain, with very different powers and interests. Under these circumstances, the attempt to ensure the main port's position by infrastructure expansion is becoming open to question. This could also be a starting point for rethinking how local and regional places could better respond to the new imperative of logistics and distribution. In this respect, it is the network paradigm that could lead the way to a more balanced, cooperative and competitive regional distribution system. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing.},

They stimulate the flow of goods towards the final consumer by means of their intermediate position between the manufacturing sector and the retail sector in the distribution channel. This paper will focus on the question whether there is a link between the position of wholesale businesses in the distribution channel and their spatial choice of location. Can the position of the wholesale sector in the distribution channel be regarded as an influential location factor or not? As such, the location factor to elaborate is the location with regard to the suppliers and buyers of wholesale firms. First, the change of the spatial pattern over the long term is set out by means of a series of maps. Second, an inquiry has been set out in order to obtain an insight to the position of wholesale firms in the distribution channel. The major findings are that the sectors of repair shops, retail, manufacturing industry and building industry have the most business contacts with wholesale firms. Most business contacts are on a national level. The position of the wholesale sector in the distribution channel alone does not explain the choice of location. But the paper shows that the position is closely linked to other factors, such as accessibility, short distances and centrality.},

@techreport{Giuliano2016,
	abstract = {This project examines changes in the spatial pattern of warehousing and distribution (W{\&}D) activities. W{\&}D activities are decentralizing in response to rising land values and scale economies. Ultimately, the authors seek to understand whether these spatial shifts result in more truck VMT, or whether the efficiencies gained by larger scale operations allow offsetting savings, such as enabling the use of larger trucks or achieving higher average load factors. Understanding how these shifts are affecting truck VMT is essential for developing effective policies for managing truck VMT and their associated emissions. However, there is no good source for tract or zone level truck flow data, or for intra-metropolitan truck origin-destination data. As a first step, the authors focus on accessibility. From the literature on passenger travel, the authors know that travel distance is related to accessibility. Thus, changes in accessibility to goods markets should be a proxy for goods travel distance, all else equal. The authors examine changes in the spatial pattern of warehousing and distribution activities for the four largest California metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and San Diego, using ZIP Code Business Patterns data for 2003 and 2013. The authors develop measures of decentralization and concentration. Their results are mixed. When using establishment counts, only Los Angeles shows a consistent pattern of decentralization. There is more evidence of decentralization when using employment counts, which is consistent with larger scale facilities being built at the periphery. Spatial patterns for the largest metro areas are quite different from those of the smaller metro areas. The authors surmise that higher development density and associated land prices push W{\&}D activity to more distant areas. In contrast, W{\&}D location in San Diego and Sacramento is relatively closer to employment, population, and the CBD. If all truck traffic were local, their results suggest possible increases in truck VMT, particularly for the largest metro areas. However, more than half of all commodity flows is non-local. The decentralization the authors observe is likely related to domestic and international trade, for which access to local markets is less important. More research is necessary to determine whether decentralization is a consistent trend in large metro areas, and, if so, whether impacts on truck VMT within metro areas is positive or negative.View the NCST Project Webpage},

@article{DablancRoss2012,
	abstract = {This paper looks at spatial patterns of freight and logistics activities and the planning and policy issues associated with them. Two important characteristics of the geography of the logistics industry are analyzed: (1) "Logistics sprawl," i.e. the spatial deconcentration of logistics facilities and distribution centers in metropolitan areas, and (2) the polarization of logistics activities, i.e. the concentration of logistics activities in very large metropolitan areas. The paper focuses on Atlanta, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States (US). Like other very large cities in the US, in recent years logistics activities have increased considerably in Atlanta. The paper also examines the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion (PAM), which has a total population of 15 million and includes Birmingham, Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte. PAM contains many distribution centers with a national and international market area, and is one of the country's fastest growing locations for logistics hubs. The megaregion concept is particularly well-suited to the analysis of freight transport systems, because freight transport's market areas, driven by global supply chains, are largely disconnected from a single city and spatially organized on a regional and multicity basis. Another focus of the paper is the question of planning for a more efficient locational pattern of freight facilities across metropolitan areas and within megaregions. Local governments compete for jobs and activities that generate tax revenues, and logistics has become a significant activity for many US metropolitan areas. The megaregion concept can contribute to a more collaborative regional planning approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The recent interest in logistics and warehousing and its impact on the urban environment has prompted research investigating the 'sprawling' nature of these firms. Logistics sprawl, i.e. the spatial deconcentration of logistics facilities and distribution centers in metropolitan areas has been examined for several metropolitan areas (Dablanc and Ross, 2012; Dablanc 2014; Dablanc et al., 2014), yielding contrasting results: Atlanta and Los Angeles have experienced strong logistics sprawl between 1998 and 2008 while Seattle has not. The objective in this paper is two-fold. An additional case study (Toronto) is investigated to expand the current understanding of North American logistics sprawl and methodological issues, particularly related to facility identification and location data are discussed. An updated method for analyzing spatial patterns of logistics activity in North American cities is subsequently proposed. This updated method may then be used in the future to re-examine former case studies (Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle) as well as to investigate new ones.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the concentration of warehouses and distribution centers (W{\&}DCs) in five counties in Southern California between 1998 and 2014, and it explores spatial relationships between W{\&}DCs and other industry sectors through centrographic and econometric modeling techniques. Furthermore, the authors estimate factors that explain the concentration of W{\&}DCs in the area. The analyses used aggregate establishment, employment, and other socioeconomic data for different industries, complemented with transportation-related variables. The results confirm the existence of logistics sprawl, although the analyses indicate that this trend did not continue to increase after 2007. Additional results follow: (a) W{\&}DCs showed a lower spatial correlation compared with other industries, (b) the locations of the weighted geometric center shifted slightly differently for the W{\&}DC industry and within its subindustries, (c) concentration levels for some subindustries were much lower than for the aggregated W{\&}DC industry, and (d) the number of W{\&}DCs could be explained by the number of establishments in the manufacturing and transportation service industries, proximity to highways and intermodal facilities, the number of W{\&}DCs and accommodation and food services in neighboring zip codes, population, the number of adults using public transit, and per capita income.},

	abstract = {Time restriction and logistics sprawl (e.g., relocating logistics facilities), as two popular urban policies, usually affect the urban freight and environmental burden, but their combination might lead to unexpected results. This paper analyzes the impact of time restriction and logistics sprawl on urban freight and local environments based on a Beijing agricultural freight case through traffic simulation. The data is derived through a freight demand forecasting method. Based on the data, this paper constructs four groups of scenarios to represent different policies (or combined policies) and then conducts macro-simulation to obtain the economic and environmental indicators. Results show that (1) time restriction can increase the freight costs and slightly decrease local emissions, while logistics sprawl can increase both costs and emissions; (2) the joint implementation of the two policies are proved to be positive in economic and environmental aspects because it helps freight carriers adopt a new strategy to improve delivery efficiency; (3) urban freight policies are closely related to the freight carriers because different responses from carriers can lead to different policy effects.},

This paper compares the growth in geographic distribution of warehouses in the Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington, metropolitan areas during that period. These two West Coast cities were chosen because of their geographic spread, proximity to major ports, as well as their size difference. The phenomenon of logistics sprawl, or the movement of logistics facilities away from urban centers, which has been demonstrated in past research for the Atlanta, Georgia, and Paris regions, is examined for the two metropolitan areas. To measure sprawl, the barycenter, or geographic center of warehousing establishments, is determined, as is the average distance of warehouses to that center. The average distance of warehouses to the warehousing barycenter was compared with the average distance from the barycenter for all establishments. Between 1998 and 2009, warehousing in Los Angeles sprawled considerably, with the average distance increasing from 25.91 to 31.96 mi, an increase of more than 6 mi. However in Seattle, the region locations remained relatively stable, showing a slight decrease in average distance from the geographic center. Possible explanations for that difference are discussed.},

The objective of this thesis is to analyze the spatial patterns and characteristics of new warehousing establishments that have located in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) since 2003. The study found that the major share of increase in number of warehouses in the GTHA occurred between the years 2005 and 2006, and years 2009 and 2010 respectively. This growth illustrates the emergence of clusters of new warehouses around the Toronto Pearson International Airport, and the Canadian National and the Canada Pacific intermodal terminals. The building footprint and the property size used for development by the new warehouses indicates the emergence of large scale warehouses in the GTHA. Inward movement of warehousing establishments towards the distribution centers of major firms has been observed.},

	abstract = {Logistics sprawl is the phenomenon driving warehouses and freight terminals further and further away from city centers, for reasons that are mostly dependent on urban planning, field price and economies of scale. In the past, studies have already described logistics sprawl in Paris Metropolitan area. These studies have concluded that logistic facilities far from Paris city center increased the distance travelled, and by extension, CO2 emissions. This study does not question logistics sprawl in Paris metropolitan area but questions its consequences. This study presents a point of view on the location of cross-docking terminals. One main parcel service carrier was studied through a database strong of 600,000 inputs including pick-ups and deliveries for two months in the Paris metropolitan area. This study is not intended to be representative of all merchandise flows but makes it possible to understand the running of one significant actor. This project aims at determining the optimum terminals location according to two criteria: minimization of the total distance as calculated by the Euclidean distance (as the crow flies) between terminals and points of pick-up/ delivery, and the number of authorized terminals. The number of terminals is modified to study its relationship with the spatial distribution of its clients. Interestingly, we found that optimized locations for this parcel service carrier are located outside of Paris city center. Those locations minimize the total distance to the clients, and thus, are the best places to limit pollution. The reason is that the carrier manages this perimeter through a polycentric organization. Paris Metropolitan area is viewed as several sectors and not as a whole for this carrier. It is therefore unknown how the carrier's performance has evolved over time, but its current organization is close to the optimal situation.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial patterns of freight and logistics activities in Metropolitan Canada. The literature acknowledges that these activities, while fundamentally important to economic and social wellbeing in cities, also contribute negatively to aspects of urban life through their associated vehicular traffic for example. The at times sprawling nature of their pattern (Dablanc, Ogilvie, {\&} Goodchild, 2014; Dablanc {\&} Ross, 2012), driven by industry desires for larger footprints, can further exacerbate these negatives. However, the existence of sprawl is not common in all major centres, with local variations in influencing factors interacting with systematic developments in the logistics industry (e.g. larger facilities). The objectives of this paper are to analyse the pattern of logistics developments in Canadian cities and to explore the factors influencing the observed patterns. The methodology employs a case study approach (building on the authors previous work on the Greater Toronto Area - (Woudsma, Jakubicek, {\&} Dablanc, 2015), obtaining fine-grained spatial data on logistics businesses and their employment levels across selected Canadian cities including Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax. The data used to assess these patterns were business listings from DMTI spatial, a Canadian provider of geospatial data. The data set used in this paper contains listings of business names, addresses, SIC codes in 2002, and NAICS and SIC codes in 2012. For analysis of this data, our approach uses basic spatial indicators, like mean centre of establishments and average distance to mean centre, along with statistical analysis of facility types and intra-regional changes. The exploration of influencing factors is conducted through in-depth review of industry publications, regional news sources, and conversations with experts in the commercial development industry in each case study city. Preliminary results indicate that in smaller metropolitan areas (Winnipeg, Halifax), the land supply pressures, and scope of logistics developments result in no evidence of sprawl. In the remaining cities, there is moderate evidence of sprawl, with noted influences including supply and local development controls. These results are discussed in the context of the current literature on urban logistics sprawl with directions for future work provided.},

This shows that logistics sprawl is a behavior experienced by warehouses in the Chicago area, but not in the Phoenix area.

The aim of this paper is to look at logistics sprawl patterns in the Gothenburg metropolitan area, in the south-west of Sweden. Looking at a medium-size monocentric urban region that is also a major port gateway for the country, this study provides novel elements in the study of locational patterns of freight facilities in metropolitan areas. It also provides an opportunity to identify the role of freight in planning, land use and zoning policies. A literature review is carried out on the issues of freight and logistics facilities locational patterns. A quantitative analysis is proposed, using data from Swedish statistics about the number of establishments with a NACE code related to logistics, as well as an original method providing a ``cleaned'' and more comprehensive dataset. We look at data at two different scales, one metropolitan and one regional, for years 2000 and 2014, as to enable a comparative and diachronical analysis. Logistics sprawl is measured by the average distance of warehouses to their common centre of gravity. Finally, interviews with transport and logistics providers as well as real estate investors and public agencies in the region, add qualitative information on the relative importance of different location factors related to logistics facilities and the issues raised. Logistics sprawl in Gothenburg occurs in specific ways, and differently at the two geographical levels of analysis.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the issue of the location of logistics activities emerged in the literature, in Europe and in the United States, especially from the perspective of logistics spatial dynamics as logistics sprawl. These issues of spatial dynamics question urban policies, because they underline the lack of interest in freight in the planning process. Indeed, one of the major issues in planning logistics facilities is the lack of a good understanding of the logistics sector: it is difficult to guide public action in the absence of detailed and precise data. The great heterogeneity of logistics facilities is often underestimated by public policies. The visibility of some sectors in public policies or academic literature, as parcel industry or e-commerce, hides other sides of logistics as an industry sector. With this paper we underline differences in the location of facilities, which translates into a difficult implementation of public policies to regulate logistics sprawl in the case of the Paris region. This paper studies precisely the location of the warehouses and terminals, and their place in the spatial organization of logistics facilities in the Paris Region. In particular, we compare the location of mass retail and wholesale trade facilities, logistics provider's facilities and parcel's industry facilities.},

Taking into account these circumstances, a phenomenon known as `logistics sprawl' is considered in the article. This is one of two problems concerning the development of logistics in metropolitan areas. Studying the Katowice conurbation in Poland, the authors note, however, that in this region the opposite phenomenon, which they define as a `logistics anti-sprawl', is more noticable. Its characteristic feature is a location of logistics facilities not in the outer zone of the conurbation, but in its core. This phenomenon undoubtedly differs from the patterns of localization of logistics facilities in all major CEECs. It is caused by some chief factors which are disscused in the paper. Therefore, an attention is drawn on the period of socialist development of the region, its contemporary postindustrialism, urban shrinkage, as well as the polycentricity of the conurbation. The crucial question whether the expected reduction of the `sprawl logistics' phenomenon may be based on the development model observed in the Katowice conurbation is also discussed in the article.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of urban sprawl has been studied extensively. Most research so far has focused on residential settlements. A growing number of studies have addressed industrial deconcentration. Our focus in this paper is on logistics sprawl, i.e. the growth and suburban relocation of warehousing activities. Specifically, we investigate the difference in logistics sprawl between monocentric and polycentric systems of cities. The literature suggests that logistics activities, like residential settlements, will gradually move to suburbs as land prices increase in central areas. As research on logistics geography has mostly focused on monocentric systems, the question is whether this also applies to polycentric systems. We compare two cases, the Paris region in France, representative of a monocentric urban development, and the Dutch Randstad area as a polycentric case. We use regional statistics on warehouse settlements in both regions for a descriptive analysis of changes since the mid-2000s to derive metrics for concentration. The cases show different patterns of change. In contrast to Paris, logistics activities within the Randstad have intensified in dense areas. We explore the reasons that may explain this difference and conclude that urban structure, spatial planning policies, and the freight hub quality of a region are factors of influence.},

Our analysis categorizes the logistics facilities into groups based on the type of commodity they handle. The analysis sheds light on the complex relationship between the location and {\#}x201C;distance optimality gap,{\#}x201D; defined as the gap between the minimum travel distance possible and the actual distance traveled by goods vehicles. The results indicate that, while the lack of available space for logistics land use near the urban center leads to significant distance optimality gaps for some logistics facility groups, such as those handling daily goods, these same locations may not be advantageous for others. Also, the logistics facilities in the exurbs are likely to have large distance optimality gaps because these locations are often far away from the origins and destinations of their shipments. In terms of land-use policy, the study reveals that simply concentrating logistics facilities near the urban core or suburbs may not reduce truck traffic. Detailed data on logistics facilities and shipments are crucial for formulating effective approaches to improve the distance optimality of logistics land use.},

	abstract = {Existing studies of urban logistics facility locations and their impacts on negative externality tend to focus on the movements of freight that start and end within a metropolitan area and overlook the role of the shipments with origin or destination outside of the urban area -- external shipments -- in characterizing logistics facilities. This research aims to fill such gap. Focusing on the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, we analyze locations and goods vehicle trips associated with four logistics facility groups that have different splits between intra and inter-regional trips for inbound and outbound shipments. The spatial density analysis and the location choice modeling highlight the differences in the distribution and location choice factors among those groups. The importance of trip distance minimization is more evident for the facilities that serve intra-regional shipments. Furthermore, we show that the traffic impacts of goods vehicle traffic associated with logistics facilities also differ in many ways among the above-mentioned groups. Finally, we discuss the policy insights to address their heterogeneity in the contribution to externality.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to identify the location of parcel transport terminals in the Paris region (the "Ile-de-France"), and discuss its impacts on Paris urban goods' movements and their carbon footprint. We present the gradual relocation of parcel transport's terminals from the urban cores in the 1970s to the outer suburban today. We evaluate whether this movement of "logistics sprawl" (the historical trend towards spatial deconcentration of logistics terminals in metropolitan areas) has an environmental and CO2 impact on the Paris region. Representations of these gradual relocations are shown on maps using MapInfo and a centrographic analysis was conducted to evaluate an average of the deconcentration of terminal locations over the period 1974-2008. A centrographic analysis is a spatial analysis of geographic data using central tendency indicators. We, then, analyze the increased mileage resulting from these more distant terminals and we translate it into net added CO2 emissions. The main results of our research are that a net addition of 15,000 tonnes per year of CO2 emissions resulted from the change in location patterns of parcel and express transport terminals since the 1970s. In this paper, we discuss the methodology chosen to evaluate freight transport's CO2 impacts in Paris. The net CO2 impacts of terminals' relocation is also compared to the savings of CO2 emissions resulting from the city logistics' experimental schemes that have received much attention in the last few years in Paris. The last part of our paper explores potential strategies for preventing further logistics sprawl in the coming years and mitigating the congestion and CO 2 impacts of logistics in urban areas. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study is to examine in detail the argument that logistics sprawls increase truck trip distances, and thus would incur negative impacts to the society. We found that between 1980 and 2003, logistics facilities in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area have migrated outward, albeit in a much smaller scale than the cases documented in some U.S. and European cities. Our analysis of the shipment data confirms that logistics sprawl increases truck travel. Furthermore, we found that, regardless of their age, logistics facilities tend to increase shipping distances as their distances to the urban center increase, due to the spatial mismatch between the locations of the facilities and the shipment origins and destinations. The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive efforts to coordinate land use, not only for logistics facilities but also other businesses that generate freight movements.},

This change in location patterns has been driven by the demand to build more modernized and larger facilities to accommodate an ever-increasing influx of freight. Since efficient freight movement is essential for the smooth functioning of metropolitan areas, decentralization should occur everywhere. However, this is not necessarily true. It is hypothesized that depending on the volume of goods movement and the spatial distribution of land prices, the extent of decentralization varies across metropolitan areas. This hypothesis is tested using 48 US metropolitan areas. Results provide robust evidence that high land prices push large warehouses away from central locations. When freight demand and land prices are not as high, the effect becomes insignificant. Indeed, not only is decentralization linked with large metro areas but also with very large warehouses.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to understand how and why warehouses have changed location over time from central urban areas to the urban periphery: spatial decentralization. Over the last decade, the logistics industry has been restructured to transport large volumes of goods more quickly and reliably. Concurrently, the warehousing industry experienced changes in facility size and location: large warehouses have been built on the urban outskirts. This spatial shift is attributed to inventory and transport cost trade-offs: the gains from lower land prices and scale operation outweigh the increase in transport costs as warehouses decentralized from central urban areas. As a case study, I examine location choices of 5364 warehousing facilities in Los Angeles, CA. I hypothesize that (a) the location choice varies by facility size and (b) the location choice logic has changed over time. Results suggest significant differences in the effect of location choice factors over facility size and over time. For warehouses built before 1980, the most influential factors are local market, labor, and seaport/intermodal terminal proximity. In contrast, for warehouses built after 2000, lower land price and airport/intermodal terminal proximity have the greatest effects.},

@article{Kang2020,
	abstract = {The logistics sprawl -- warehousing and distribution centers relocating farther away from central urban areas to the urban periphery -- has been widely examined in multiple global trade gateways. The spatial shifts have been attributed to the systematic and geographic restructuring of goods production and distribution systems at the global scale. More recently, growing online shopping sales and demand for instant delivery have put tremendous pressure on online retail businesses to locate order fulfillment centers in urban areas with direct access to the consumer markets. Has the trend of sprawling warehouses reversed? Have warehouses been relocating closer to consumer demand? In this research, I use a relative distribution measure to quantify the spatial distribution of warehouses relative to the logistics sector, the goods movement sector, and the general population over time. The main data source is ZIP Code Business Patterns from 2003 to 2016 with the study area of the 64 largest US metropolitan areas. In 2016, warehouses were most closely distributed relative to logistics sectors (38.6 km), followed by goods movement sectors (41.2 km), and population (43.5 km). From 2003 to 2016, the distance between warehouses and related businesses has increased, but the extent varies with respect to metropolitan and warehouse size. The trend of increasing relative distance from warehouses to related businesses stopped since the economic recession in 2008. Relative distribution measures are significantly correlated with internal ground shipment ton-kilometers but only in large trade gateways.},

	abstract = {The spatial mismatch between warehouse locations and urban freight demand mainly driven by logistics sprawl can have negative environmental impacts, due to the increase in average trucking distances. This study investigated the spatial dimension of warehouse rent determinants identifying the regional specifics of supply and demand of warehouse facilities and services. Based on the case of the Seoul Metropolitan Area in South Korea, spatial autoregressive regression (SAR) and mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models were developed to explain the spatial stationary and non-stationary relationship between warehouse rent and the explanatory variables, including the transactional characteristics of the rental contracts, physical characteristics of the buildings, location factors, and various warehousing services. The MGWR results identified the distance to the nearest highway interchange, repackaging service, and built-in ramps as globally fixed variables and contract floor space, total building floor space, building age, and land price as locally varying variables. The results of this study allowed us to provide meaningful insights into the sustainable development of urban logistics facilities through a better understanding of the interaction between logistics activities, transportation infrastructure, and land use.},
	annote = {This does not study logistics sprawl. It studies the spatial determinants of warehouse rent by loking at regional supply and demand. It uses a dataset collected for a Masters thesis.

QUOTE

Because warehouse rent transaction records are not publicly available in South Korea, we used the data originally collected by Yang [32] who conducted surveys and interviews in 2015 to rental warehouse clients, including manufacturers, retailers, and third-party logistics companies. The original data include 153 rental records for 120 warehouses out of the 931 rental warehouses in the SMA registered to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) in 2015. The scope of the present study is focused on the 122 rental records for the regular (dry) warehouses. The analysis for the remaining 31 records for the cold/refrigerated warehouse is left for future study as they have distinctively different market characteristics. The data used in the present study include specifications of the lease contract, physical characteristics of the building, locational attributes, and additional warehousing services as listed in Table 1.

	abstract = {The construction of logistics centres and the selection of their localities affects not only the activities of urban goods movement, but also the urban environment. The phenomenon called as logistics sprawl, i.e. the relocation of logistics facilities away from inner urban areas to suburban areas has received an increasing level of attention from scientific community and public as well. The paper results are focused on the square increase of logistics centres in Prague's suburb with the use of satellite images. These images were compared with the cadastre of the Czech Republic. Build up squares of logistics centres enlarged about 400.104 (m2) in suburb from the year 2013 to 2018 at the expense of agricultural land. This fact can exacerbate the quality of life in the Prague´s suburban areas.},

Sattelite imagery was downloaded and processed using supervised learning workflow. (See quote below)

Results were verified against the "cadastre of the Czech Republic" but only for two of the 8 survey areas
"The Cadastre is a source of information that records rights to real estate for the purposes of taxes and fees, and protects agricultural land, forests, natural resources and cultural monuments."



DESCRIPTION OF METHODS USED (QUOTE)

Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from 15.5.2013 and 13.5.2018 were down-loaded
from Geological Survey of U.S. (USGS) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) in Level 1 -- Top of Atmos-phere reflectance format. The images were converted to Level 2 Bottom of Atmosphere reflectance
format with the help of atmospheric correction module ENVI 5.5 SW.

Sentinel 2B Multispectral Instru-ment (MSI) from 14.5.2018 was downloaded from Copernicus Open Access Hub
(https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) in L2A format which equals the Bottom of Atmosphere reflectance. Pre-processing of Sentinel 2 image consisted of individual band resampling to the same spatial resolution.
In the case of this image it was 10 m. The surveyed areas were cut and classified into five categories
supported of supervised classification tool (ENVI 5.5 software made by Excelis, Inc., McLean, USA).
Basic four categories as ``arable land'', ``forest land'', ``built-up area'', and ``water area'' were selected for
better landscape type differentiation. The fifths category was ``logistics centres''. Result of supervised
classification workflow were raster data formats of surveyed areas. Rasters were edited with the help of
``Edit Classification Image'' post-classification tool and then converted to vector data formats and pro-cessed by the geo-processing tool in ArcGIS 10.4.1 software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The areas
were obtained in square metres. Next processing was based on statistical comparison of L8 images from
2013 and 2018 and then L8 from 2013 and S2 from 2018 (S2 images have been available since 2016).
The results derived from satellite images were then verified by actual information from the cadastre of
the Czech Republic (https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/, 28.3.2019). It was calculated only for the areas III.
and VII., where the highest increase of logistics centres square was monitored.





USEFUL QUOTE

Currently, the most used satellite systems became
Landsat with medium spatial resolution (30 m) and Sentinel 2 from European Space Agency Copernicus
Programme with 10 m spatial resolution for visible and near-infrared part of electromagnetic spectra. In
contrary to relatively new Copernicus programme Landsat images have a regularly sampled historical
archive of 40 years (Ghosh et al., 2014). Land cover classification seems to be as one of the most studied
topics in remote sensing, especially for agricultural, forest or land changes purposes (Zhu {\&} Woodcock,
2014). Currently, many advanced tools as classification workflows allow this process make relatively
easy. Nevertheless, it is not easy to make it accurate. Higher classification accuracy is usually achieved
using different land cover product (Friedl et al., 2010).},

However, at a more refined level, because of land prices, availability and modern logistics schemes, suburban locations are preferred. This trend, the so-called logistics sprawl, creates land consumption, longer supply chains and jobs shifts. This article analyses the geography of logistics in the Brussels metropolitan area and highlights this suburbanization, notwithstanding the fact that some particularities appear, due to the Brussels, Belgian and European contexts. In a second step, we construct a spatial typology to understand the fine evolution of the Brussels metropolitan logistics space. These results reinforce our knowledge of logistics geography and add a frequently neglected institutional dimension to the extant literature on the subject -- wholesale trade activities.},
